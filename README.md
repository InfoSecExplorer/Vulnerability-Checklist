* Now Email Spoofing happens due to two main reasons :
1. SPF record not set for the particular email
2. Missing of DMARC protocol for the particular email
* Go to your target company and collect all the possible emails of that company
* Now check the SPF and DMARC record of all the emails : https://mxtoolbox.com/
* Now if you get an email (xyz@company.com), then go for its exploitation
* Visit https://emkei.cz/ in order to exploit the issue
* Here you’ll need to fill From-email, To and Subject
* In From-email add the company’s email and in To add your own email and in Subject you can add anything (like Hacking You, Bounty Time etc.)

* Now check your email and you will get your password reset link.
* Click on any social media link you see in that email and password reset page.
* Don't change the password before clicking on any external links like social media links for the same website.
* Capture that request in burp suite, You will find a reset token in the referer header.

**Reset password link sent over unsecured http protocol**
* Go to the target website and request a password reset.
* Check email, you will get a reset password link.
* Copy that link paste in the notepad and observe the protocol.

**Password Reset Token Leak via X-Forwarded-Host**
* Intercept the password reset request in Burp Suite
* Add or edit the following headers in Burp Suite : Host: attacker.com, X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com.
* Forward the request with the modified header.
* Look for a password reset URL based on the host header like : https://attacker.com/reset-password.php?token=TOKEN.

## RATE LIMIT BYPASS TECHNIQUES

**1. Using different parameter**
* suppose rate limit is on signup, try to use - sign-up, Sign-up, SignUp, try for password reset and email conformation. 

**2. Customizing HTTP Methods**
* If the request goes on GET try to change it to POST, PUT, OPTIONS, .,
* If you wanna bypass the rate-limit in API's try HEAD method.

**3. Try for null payloads**

**4. Using Null Characters**
* Null payloads: %00, %0d%0a, %09, %0C, %20, %0, %00, %00%00, %00%00%00, %00%00%00%00, %00%00%00%00%00, %20, %09, %0d and %0a.
* For example, test@email.com%00 and add null payloads in session and cookie headers.

**5. Adding HTTP Headers to Spoof IP and Evade Detection**
* X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-By: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarded-For-Original: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forwarder-For: 127.0.0.1
* X-Forward-For: 127.0.0.1
* Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
* Forwarded-For-Ip: 127.0.0.1
* X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
* X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
* X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
* X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
* rate limiting bypass payloads: https://github.com/blackangl1/bypass-rate-limit-payloads/blob/main/payload.txt

**6. Case sensitiveness**
* Rate limit in: victim@gmaii.com email address
* Rate limit bypass : Victim@gmaii.com, and 10 more request
* Rate limit bypass : VIctim@gmaii.com and 10 more request
* Rate limit bypass : VICtim@gmaii.com …..
* Rate limit bypass : VICTim@gmaii.com ………
* Rate limit bypass : VICTIm@gmaii.com …..
* Rate limit bypass : VICTIM@gmaii.com and many more

**7. bypass the rate limit protection on the Forgot Password feature using the X-Forwarded-For header**
* Navigate to the Forgot Password page of the target website.
* Submit a password reset request using your email address.
* capture the Forgot Password request in burpsuite.
* Looped the request 50 times, from 127.0.0.1 till 127.0.0.50 (value of the X-Forwarded-For header).
* Check the responses to ensure that the rate limit is being bypassed and that each request is processed as if it came from a different IP address.

## CAPTCHA BYPASS TECHNIQUES

**1. Reuse Previous Captcha:** 
* This technique involves using a captcha code that you’ve seen or solved before, assuming that the same code will work again multiple times.

**2. Submit Empty Captcha:** 
* Trying to bypass the captcha by leaving the captcha field empty when submitting a form.

**3. Alter Data Format:** 
* Changing the format in which data is sent to the server, such as converting it to JSON or plain text, in the hope that the captcha won’t be validated.

**4. Change Request Method:**
* Create a new request by entering right captcha value.
* Intercept the request in a proxy tool.
* The request will look like this:
* Now change the method from POST to PUT and right submit the request.

**5. Manipulate Headers:** 
* Using custom headers like X-Forwarded-For, X-Remote-IP, X-Original-IP, X-Remote-Addr, etc., to make it appear as though the requests are coming from different IP addresses, thereby avoiding captcha validation.

6. CAPTCHA bypass will be possible by changing the response parameter values from false to true.

7. CAPTCHA bypass will be possible by manipulating the response message for ex. Changing the CAPTCHA is invalid to CAPTCHA is valid.    

**8. Null Payloads:**
* Went to Forget Password and filled details along with Captcha
* Captured Request with Burp Proxy.
* Neither turned off Interception nor Forwarded the Request.
* Sent Request to Intruder and played 300 times with null payloads.
* Success!!Captcha mechanism was validating the initial request which was on hold with Proxy before expiring the captcha.

**Failed Captcha verification**
* Open your browser and navigate to the login page of the web application you want to test.
* In the login form, enter a valid email address and an incorrect password.
* Submit the form.
* Repeat this step multiple times to observe the web application's behavior.
* Attempt to log in again with the valid email address and incorrect password while the CAPTCHA is present.
* Burp Suite will capture this login request.
* Check if the server accepts the modified request and logs you in without verifying the CAPTCHA.

## EMAIL VERIFICATION BYPASS 

**Email verification bypass after signup**
* Sing up on the web application as attacker@mail.com
* You will receive a confirmation email on attacker@mail.com, do not open that link now.
* The application may ask for confirming your email, check if it allows navigating to the account settings page.
* On the settings page check if you can change the email.
* If allowed, change the email to victim@mail.com.
* Now you will be asked to confirm victim@mail.com by opening the confirmation link received on victim@mail.com, instead of opening the new link go to attacker@mail.com inbox and open
* the previous received link.If the application verifies vitim@mail.com by using previous verification link received on attacker mail, then this is an email verification bypass.

**Email Authentication Bypass account registration process**
* created an account with attacker@gmail.com, upon registration you will receive an email verification link.
* Click the link and verify attacker account.
* Next, I went into the Edit profile and changed the Email to victim@gmail.com.
* after change the email you logged out of attacker account, you will receive a message “A verification email has been sent to the new updated email.
* I just went into attacker@gmail.com mail, and clicked on the same link which was sent to me during my initial registration process.
* Now I just went into the login page and entered the Email as attacker@gmail.com and attacker account password, successfully bypassed email authrntication.

**Email Verification code bypass in account registration process**
* First visit your website on the sign up page.
* Enter your email and create a password.
* Enter name and mobile phone, then sign up.
* Then request for verification code on email.
* Enter wrong verification code and intercept requests using Burp suite.
* After intercepting the request, I changed the status from "False" to "True". {"status":false to "status":true}
* Boom!! Verification code bypassed.
* Finally, the account was created with the wrong verification code.
* Reference Link: https://hackerone.com/reports/1406471 https://hackerone.com/reports/1181253 

**Email Verification Bypass leads to account takeover**
* Try registering any email address without verifying it.
* Try registering an account again, but this time with a different method, such as ‘sign up with Google’ from the same email address.
* see it will successfully bypass the Email verification methods.
* What happens here is, now the attacker can easily log in using the victim's account which bypasses the verification methods.
* Reference: https://hackerone.com/reports/1074047 

**Email Verification Bypass by brute forcing Attack**
* Attacker creates a account with victim's email ID Ex: victim@gmail.com
* Now he doesn't know the verification code.
* Attackers will start brute force attacks to get the correct verification code.
* Once the Attacker gets the verification code.
* Finally, the account was created using victim Email.
* Reference Link; https://hackerone.com/reports/1394984 https://hackerone.com/reports/64666 

## TWO FACTOR AUTEHTICATION BYPASS 

**OTP Bypass on Register account via Response manipulation**
* Register account with mobile number and request for OTP.
* Enter incorrect OTP and capture the request in Burp Suite.
* Do intercept response to this request and forward the request.
* response will be {"verificationStatus":false,"mobile":9072346577","profileId":"84673832"}
* Change this response to {"verificationStatus":true,"mobile":9072346577","profileId":"84673832"}     

**OTP Bypass Second Method**
* Go to login and wait for OTP pop up.
* Enter incorrect OTP and capture the request in Burp Suite.
* Do intercept response to this request and forward the request. response will be error
* Change this response to success, And forward the response, You will be logged in to the account.

**Third Method**
* Register 2 accounts with any 2 mobile number(first enter right otp)
* Intercept your request click on action -> Do intercept -> intercept response to this request.
* check what the message will display like status:1
* Follow the same procedure with other account but this time enter wrong otp
* Intercept response to the request, See the message like you get status:0
* Change status to 1 i.e, status:1 and forward the request if you logged in means you just did an authentication bypass.

## SESSION MANAGEMENT RELATED VULNERABILITIES 

**Session Hijacking**
* Create your account.
* Login your account.
* Use cookie editor extension in browser.
* Copy all the target cookies and Logout your account.
* Paste that cookie on another browser in the cookie editor extension.
* Refresh page if you are logged in then this is a session hijacking.

**Old Session Does Not Expire After Password Change
Old Session Does Not Expire After Email change
Old Session Does Not Expire After 2FA Enabled
Old Session Does Not Expire After 2FA Enabled
Old Session Does Not Expire After Account Delete**
* Create an account on the target site.
* Log in to your account using two different browsers with the same account (Chrome and Firefox).
* Change your password in the Chrome browser.
* Refresh the Firefox browser.
* If you are still logged in, then this indicates a bug.

## CROSS SITE SCRIPTING VULNERABILITIES 

* waybackurls testphp.vulnweb.com | grep '=' | qsreplace '"><script>alert(1)</script>' | while read host do ; do curl -sk --path-as-is "$host" | grep -qs "<script>alert(1)</script>" && echo "$host is vulnerable"; done
* gospider -S live_subdomains.txt -c 10 -d 5 --blacklist ".(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|tif|tiff|png|ttf|woff|woff2|ico|pdf|svg|txt)" --other-source | grep -e "code-200" | awk '{print $5}'| grep "=" | qsreplace -a | dalfox pipe | tee OUT.txt

* echo testphp.vulnweb.com | httpx -silent | hakrawler -subs | grep "=" | qsreplace '"><svg onload=confirm(1)>' | airixss -payload "confirm(1)" | egrep -v 'Not'

**New Way To Find Simple Cross site scripting (xss)!!!**
* I visit example.com and I see there is a chat system on the right side of the website.
* I clicked on other information and they asked me to enter my full name. I put payload <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)> email i put a contact number also and then click to process and BOOM !!!


## OPEN REDIRECTION VULNERABILITY 

**First method**
* Go to https://www.private.com
* Capture the request in the burp suite
* Send this request to intruder
* Set payload after domain directly For ex: private.com/$test$
* Replace $text$ with your open redirect payloads.
* Add all open redirect payloads in the intruder
* Click on Start attack, Check for 301 response
* Payloads link: https://medium.com/@cyb3rD1vvya/open-redirection-b6c2505f1f44 

**Second Method**
* If the Application has a user Sign-In/Sign-Up feature, then register a user and log in as the user.
* Go to your user profile page , for example : samplesite.me/accounts/profile
* Copy the profile page's URL, Logout and Clear all the cookies and go to the homepage of the site.
* Paste the Copied Profile URL on the address bar.
* If the site prompts for a login , check the address bar , you may find the login page with a redirect parameter like the following, https://samplesite.me/login?next=accounts/profile,
* https://samplesite.me/login?retUrl=accounts/profile
* Try to exploit the parameter by adding an external domain and load the crafted URL eg:- https://samplesite.me/login?next=https://evil.com/ (or) https://samplesite.me/login?next=https://samplesite.me@evil.com/ #(to beat the bad regex filter)
* If it redirects to evil.com , there's your open redirection bug.
* Try to leverage it to XSS eg:- https://samplesite.me/login?next=javascript:alert(1);//

**Open Redirect to XSS**
* Open your browser and go to the login page: https://example.com/login.
* In the address bar, modify the URL to include the redirect parameter with the payload: https://example.com/login?redirect=http://;@google.com.
* Press Enter and observe if you are redirected to http://google.com.
* If you are successfully redirected to http://google.com, this confirms the open redirect vulnerability.
* Change the redirect URL to test for XSS: https://example.com/login?redirect=javascript:alert(1).
* Press Enter to navigate to this URL.
* If the application is vulnerable, after logging in, the JavaScript payload will execute, resulting in an alert pop-up displaying 1.
* payloads: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Open%20Redirect
* waybackurls vulnweb.com | grep -a -i =http | qsreplace 'http://evil.com' | while read host do;do curl -s -L $host -I| grep "evil.com" && echo "$host \033[0;31mVulnerable\n" ;done
* subfinder -d target.com | httprobe |tee live_domain.txt; cat live_domain.txt | waybackurls | tee wayback.txt; cat wayback.txt | sort -u | grep "\?" > open.txt; nuclei -t ~/nuclei-templates/http/vulnerabilities/generic/open-redirect-generic.yaml -l open.txt
* nuclei -l open.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/dast/vulnerabilities/redirect/open-redirect.yaml

## CROSS SITE REQUESR FORGERY(CSRF)

**Common flaws in CSRF token validation**
* Interact with the application functionality and intercept the request using a proxy tool.
* Send this request to the repeater and right-click to change the request method from POST to GET.
* Generate a CSRF proof of concept (POC) and modify it according to your preferences.
* Ethically deliver the manipulated request to the victim, demonstrating the potential impact of the CSRF vulnerability.

* If changing the referrer header is ineffective, suppress the referrer header using techniques like <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">.
* Generate a normal proof of concept (POC) using the chosen technique.
* Ethically deliver the manipulated request to the victim, demonstrating the circumvention of Referrer-based CSRF defenses.

**Send null value in CSRF token**
* Interact with the application functionality and intercept the request using a proxy tool.
* Send this request to the repeater.
* Replace the CSRF token value with a null value and generate a CSRF POC.
* Customize the CSRF POC according to your preferences.

**Change CSRF value and add same-length string**
* Interact with the application functionality and intercept the request using a proxy tool.
* Send this request to the repeater.
* Modify the CSRF token value by adding a string of the same length and generate a CSRF proof of concept (POC).
* Customize the CSRF POC according to your preferences.
* Ethically deliver the manipulated request to the victim, highlighting the exploitability of changing the CSRF value while maintaining its length.

**CSRF Bypass tips**
* Change Request Method POST to GET
* Remove Total Token Parameter\
* Remove The Token, And Give a Blank Parameter
* Copy a Unused Valid Token , By Dropping The Request and Use That Token
* Use Own CSRF Token To Feed it to Victim
* Replace Value With Of A Token of Same Length
* Reverse Engineer The Token
* Extract Token via HTML injection
* Switch From Non-Form Content-Type: application/json or Content-Type: application/x-url-encoded To Content-Type: form-multipart
* Change/delete the last or first character from the token
* Change referrer to Referrer

































**SERVER SIDE TEMPLATE INJECTION ( EASILY FOUND )**
* I visit Example.com and I see there is a chat system on the right side of the website.
* I clicked on I’m interested they ask me to enter my email i put victim email id there and then they ask me for my first name i put SSTI basic Payload {{7*7}} and same as I entered this in my last name and after some time almost half an hour I received an email like this BOOM !! You can see there is HEY , 49 And i enter {{7*7}} payload so it means 7*7 is 49 and here it is work.
* tplmap -u 'http://www.target.com/page.php?id=1'











**Insecure direct object references (IDOR)**
* Register and log in with your credentials.
* Give Your email id in Newsletter for further updates.
* go to mail, which was sent by Redacted.com and click the unsubscribe.
* You will get the following parameters: https://Redacted.com/account/en-GB/unsubscribe/confirmation?a=a3a4b8d7–94fe-4c73-ba3.
* Before clicking the unsubscribe button turn on the burp suite, capture the request and check the post and GET requests parameters like name, and Email.
* In my case, it was the GET request https://Redacted.com/account/en-GB/unsubscribe/confirmation?a=a3a4b8d7–94fe-4c73-ba32-b25c&e=attacker@gmai1.com.
* Now change the email address attacker@gmail.com to victim@gmail.com. By doing so, I was successfully able to unsubscribe the victim’s email address.

**IDOR To view other private users profile pictures**
* Log in to the application and go to the profile picture upload section of your user account.
* Upload a valid image file, Confirm that the profile picture is successfully uploaded and displayed on your profile.
* Open your profile picture in a new tab and observe the URL structure: https://un.org/profile/123456/default-pic/pictures-12343544.
* Modify the '123456' segment in the URL to another user ID, such as https://un.org/profile/123457/default-pic/pictures-12343544.
* Observe that changing this segment displays the profile picture of the user with the ID 123457

**Information Disclosure - WordPress**
* Go to any website that uses wordpress CMS (You can identify website technologies using wappalyzer).
* Right click on any image and click on view image.
* Now the following page will appear which will be having the URL : https://www.website.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo.png.

* If your still able to see the photo means it is vulnerable to Insecure Data Storage.

**Privilege Escalation**
* Go to your target website that is using WordPress CMS
* Use the wpscan tool to check for the out-dated plugins, themes, default credentials etc.
* My command : wpscan --url https://target.com --disable-tls-check --enumerate u
* After the scan is completed you’ll get the result of out-dated and vulnerable things.
* In my case it was vulnerable to “WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System”

**Path Traversal**
* Go to https://www.private.com.
* Capture the request in the burp suite.
* Send this request to intruder.
* Set payload after domain directly For ex: private.com/$test$.
* Replace with path traversal payloads and check the response.
